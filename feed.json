After reading it cover to cover and working through the final chapters' end-to-end projects, I have some thoughts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In summary: I loved this book. It tackles a vast, complex topic, but the style is conversational and never feels too overwhelming.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who should read <em>Machine Learning Engineering With Python</em>?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This book is about machine learning operations (MLOps) and discusses every aspect of the machine learning model lifecycle, a truly ambitious goal. Machine learning algorithms, model registries, pipelines and orchestration, creating APIs, containers, monitoring and alerting, cleaning data, Kubernetes, model testing, it's all here. And the book doesn't stop at running code on your local machine: there are several step-by-step instructions for deploying to the cloud (AWS).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'd highly recommend <em>Machine Learning Engineering With Python</em> if any of the following is true:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>You want a good mental model of MLOps and what roles are involved (<em>e.g.</em>, data scientists, operations engineers, data engineers).</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>You'd like some hands-on experience with MLOps tooling.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>You're interested in some of the trade-offs to consider when building a machine learning project.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n</ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Given that the book covers an astounding amount of ground in just over 400 pages, I wouldn't recommend the book to:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Anyone with little or no Python experience.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Anyone looking for a deep dive into specific MLOps topics (this isn't a criticism: the goal of the book is to present an end-to-end overview of the machine learning lifecycle).</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n</ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why I Read It</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've been working on the periphery of MLOps for the past several years. As a data engineer, I extract data, model it, and get it to users. Some of these users then do mysterious things like \"hyperparameter tuning\" and \"feature engineering\" and \"registering models.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Because it's always useful to understand what people are doing with your data, I wanted to demystify these activities and understand them at a high level. <em>Machine Learning Engineering With Python</em> delivered. If you're in the same boat, don't hesitate to buy the book. <strong>Highly, highly recommend--you will benefit, even if you don't do the coding exercises.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hands-On</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition to understanding the components of MLOps, I also wanted experience with tools of the trade. To get that, I skipped most of the code samples in the earlier chapters of the book and dove into the end-to-end projects presented in chapters 8 and 9.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The presentation of these projects was excellent. For each technical decision (<em>e.g.</em>, which training algorithm to use, how to serve models), McMahon presents several options and walks readers through the pros and cons of each one. Incredibly valuable for people trying to strengthen their mental model in the MLOps space.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My one suggestion is that the code for these projects (from the book's <a href=\"https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Machine-Learning-Engineering-with-Python-Second-Edition/tree/main/Chapter08\">GitHub</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Machine-Learning-Engineering-with-Python-Second-Edition/tree/main/Chapter09\">repo</a>) could be more organized: neither the book nor the READMEs had clear instructions for standing up a working system.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I suspect this is a result of the author trying to give his readers all the things!

You might also remember that programming was a job and not a lifestyle. You weren‚Äôt in ‚Äútech,‚Äù you worked for the electric company, writing the code for their billing system. A pretty fun job, and a solid middle class living.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Regardless of what we call ourselves now, telling computers what to do remains a good way to earn money (for now, until the robots take over). A ‚Äútech‚Äù job is a ticket to the middle class or, depending on where you work and live, the upper middle class.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a result, lots of people are out there trying to ‚Äúbreak into tech.‚Äù At the same time, companies always seem to be hiring (even during these Unprecedented Times‚Ñ¢Ô∏è), often lamenting how hard it is to find ‚Äúgood talent.‚Äù</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Streetlight Effect</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To recap: a bunch of places are trying to hire for jobs that a bunch of people want to do. And yet, these places find it difficult to fill the positions. I‚Äôm glossing over some nuance, but it‚Äôs pretty hard to see this situation as anything other than a problem companies have created for themselves.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There‚Äôs an¬†<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect\">old story</a>¬†about a drunk man who loses his keys in a park, yet searches for them under a streetlight, because that‚Äôs where the light is shining. It‚Äôs a decent metaphor for the current state of tech hiring. The light is shining on a limited number of people who went to particular schools, who work at certain companies, who are connected to the right people, or who meet some other easy-to-pattern-match criteria.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the whole, companies don‚Äôt hire outside the boundaries of the streetlight. How strange that ‚Äúinnovators‚Äù straight-up ignore what seems like an obvious advantage: finding great people in places your competitors aren‚Äôt even looking.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Old Days, Before Dot Com</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So back to the pre-dot-com days of programming. There was no expectation that new hires would join the company fully formed and ready to commit code on day one. Aspiring software developers did not simply sit around in coffee shops training themselves on side projects, since laptops cost $3,000 and dial-up ruled the land.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thus, companies had to invest in creating the workforce they wanted.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nowadays, when someone rants about laundry-list job descriptions or multiple coding-style interviews, they‚Äôre often perceived as wanting to ‚Äúlower the bar.‚Äù</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It‚Äôs maddening. A lot of this perception is gatekeeping, but some of it is the result of a field that skews young and isn‚Äôt aware of its own history. Through many conversations, I‚Äôve realized that people are so mired in the current status quo they genuinely can‚Äôt envision tech hiring in any other form. They don‚Äôt realize there was ever another way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For that reason, here is the abbreviated process for how I ‚Äúbroke into tech,‚Äù just as one small example of another way to cultivate programming talent.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">One Company‚Äôs Investment</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Several months after graduating with an English degree, I got a programming job offer. It was from a consulting firm that hired people with sound logic and communication skills and onboarded them at a six week COBOL bootcamp in Boston.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The company¬†<em>paid us to go to bootcamp, not the other way around</em>. They very sensibly decided that a good way to get COBOL programmers was to hire smart people and teach them to be COBOL programmers. As a bonus, the instructors also taught the company‚Äôs corporate ethos, molding us into just the kind of junior associates needed to round out project teams.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The training program wasn‚Äôt an act of kindness‚Äìit was an act of capitalism. The company invested in new employees and in return were able to put us on client projects for decent hourly rates. Trainees got good starting salaries and were able to learn on the job. We worked hard to prove ourselves, and our clients benefited.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Interview Process</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This was the interview cycle:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Conversation with a recruiter who asked about general skills and accomplishments; no expectation that those would be tech-related.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Written communication test (can you convey ideas effectively).</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Written logic test (high-level, flowchart-type stuff).</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>If the above went well, final interview with a partner.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>If the partner interview went well, candidates got a job offer, contingent upon passing a computer-based, multiple choice test of COBOL concepts. Company provided a book to study from and a place to practice.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Once you passed the COBOL test, the offer was confirmed: you became an employee, and began six weeks of paid training.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>After training, you were assessed on two measures: a re-take of the COBOL test and the instructor‚Äôs appraisal of your ability to learn, communicate, and get work done.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n</ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time to Revisit?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By no means were things perfect, and the program certainly wasn‚Äôt a gatekeeping-free utopia. There was a college degree requirement, for example. And having to spend six weeks training in Boston meant few caregivers could participate. And while there were many women, we were mostly white.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So the company‚Äôs hiring pool was smaller than it could have been, but it was much larger than the pool most places fish from today. They assessed for potential, employing hundreds, if not thousands, of people this way, proving that engineering is a teachable skill and is more than writing code.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fix the broken bits, and this model would be a starting point for companies of a certain size to find the smart, talented people working their asses off for a shot at the jobs so many of us lucked into all those years ago.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",
