			 <p>There&rsquo;s a youth basketball coach in town who dispenses the following wisdom:</p>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t be willy-nilly.</em></p>
<p>At the level he coaches, kids have learned the value of passing the ball, but sometimes they forget to make sure there&rsquo;s someone ready to <em>receive</em> the ball. Someone&rsquo;s in a jam, and without looking around, they sling the ball in the direction with the least amount of hands from the opposing team.</p>
<p>When that happens, the coach shouts &ldquo;willy-nilly!&rdquo; Those two words convey so much, and I&rsquo;m going to incorporate them into my 2026 vocabulary.</p>

<p>I recently finished working my way through <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/figure-drawing-methods-for-artists-over-130-methods-for-sketching-drawing-and-artistic-discovery-peter-boerboom/b45ea412e673846a?ean=9781631594366&amp;next=t"><em>Figure Drawing Methods for Artists: Over 130 Methods for Sketching, Drawing, and Artistic Discovery</em></a></p>
<p>I bought the book on a whim, not knowing what to expect. It doesn&rsquo;t have instructions for drawing detailed hands or facial expressions. Instead, <em>Figure Drawing Methods for Artists</em> provides prompts that focus on the essence of a form. Is it active or at rest? How do small details like posture and eyebrows convey mood? It turns out that a few imperfect and quickly rendered lines can convey more than you&rsquo;d think.</p>
<p>Sometimes I pick a random figure in my camera roll and draw it as quickly as possible, maybe a minute. My normal inclination is to obsess over details prematurely, so the time limit is key for retraining the old brain to focus on simplicity.</p>

			 <p>There was a two hour school delay this morning, and we used the time to vibe code a <a href="https://bsweger.github.io/rizzy/">Rizz Calculator</a> that the sixth grader can use to troll his friend Ryan:

He provided the requirements, and I fed them to Claude Code, telling it to use the <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov">open-source US Web Design System</a> for the calculator&rsquo;s look and feel (my standard hack for making demos sites that look decent). We had it up on GitHub pages in less than 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Everyone gets a random score between 0 and 8,000, except for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bsweger/rizzy/commit/1c45dcc72ac82b34008d12b6b98eeb6a8fde61ec">Ryan (the friend being trolled) gets a score between -8000 and -1</a></li>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m still chipping away at <a href="https://bsweger.github.io/pyprefab/">pyprefab</a>, a little CLI that spits out boilerplate code for new Python packages. It has two stars on GitHub!</p>
<p>Could this app have been a cookie cutter template? Probably? But then I&rsquo;d miss the fun of noodling around and staying versed in the art of packaging and publishing to PyPI. And although I frequently use pyprefab to spin up ad-hoc projects, it&rsquo;s the noodling around that&rsquo;s been the most valuable exercise.</p>
<p>Treating a code base like an actual project that people use and contribute to⎻even when that&rsquo;s not true⎻is great practice. Especially for the dev environment tooling, since my current job involves some scripts but not application development per se.</p>
<p>Some of the internal improvements over the last few months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Made the logging level configurable</li>
<li>Added a <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2025/11/21/We-should-all-be-using-dependency-cooldowns">cooldown period for dependency updates</a></li>
<li>Added <a href="https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/">nox</a> for testing in multiple Python versions</li>
<li>Switched <code>.python-version</code> to 3.14 because the REPL improvements alone are worth it</li>
<li>Improved GitHub workflow security</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the above changes aren&rsquo;t too relevant for a small solo project, but keeping pyprefab in good shape not only makes it reliable, it makes the repo a good place to mine for configs, patterns, and incantations to use in other work.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file">newly-released source code</a> for <a href="https://directfile.irs.gov">IRS Direct File</a> is a truly important artifact for:</p>
<ul>
<li>anyone who has tried to express the U.S. tax code programmatically</li>
<li>anyone interested in how teams make technical decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The former group should check out the <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file/blob/main/docs/engineering/tax-flow/Tax_Code_to_Factgraph.pdf">Fact Graph</a>, which deserves its own post (IRS DAG, anyone?).</p>
<p>For the latter, the repo&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file/tree/main/docs">docs directory</a> has all kinds of rare treats. If you&rsquo;ve ever worked in government, you know how hard it is to publish <em>anything</em>, let alone something that describes your thinking or lessons learned. Much respect to the Direct File team for including artifacts about their research and decisions.</p>
<p>The themes of the project&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file/tree/main/docs/adr">architectural decision records</a> (ADRs) are pragmatism and simplicity. Which isn&rsquo;t to say that Direct File is simple. My impression is that the team rightly chose to spend more time on unsolved problems (<em>e.g.</em>, representing the tax code as a graph) and less time on solved problems (databases).</p>
<p>These ADRs were some of my highlights, but they&rsquo;re all worth reading.</p>
<h3 id="on-simple-databaseshttpsgithubcomirs-publicdirect-fileblobmaindocsadradr_user_supplied_infomd">On simple <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file/blob/main/docs/adr/adr_user_supplied_info.md">databases</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The data we are planning to store is not so large as to cause a problem for any common RDBMS provider. There won&rsquo;t be any particular slowdown or read issues associated with reading the data out of the database.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We can architect around having the database be a single point of failure in our system&hellip; If our database system does go completely down, our system will go down as well. Introducing another system doesn&rsquo;t solve that problem, and it in fact compounds the problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> They went with Postgres</p>
<h3 id="on-choosing-programming-languageshttpsgithubcomirs-publicdirect-fileblobmaindocsadradr-languagemd">On <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file/blob/main/docs/adr/adr-language.md">choosing programming languages</a></h3>
<p>I confess to pouting a bit after realizing that DIrect File is Java-heavy, which is why I really appreciated this ADR.</p>
<p>In addition to noting that the IRS is already a Java shop, the document lists a number of other <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file/blob/main/docs/adr/adr-language.md#technical-questions">technical considerations</a>, many of which aren&rsquo;t obvious to someone without tax domain experience. For example, Direct File needs a language that works well with WSDL/SOAP because that&rsquo;s the basis of the electronic filing system it integrates with (<a href="https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/modernized-e-file-program-information">IRS Modernized e-File system</a>).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a lot of Scala in Direct File, an unexpected choice for government. However, Scala has strong support for graph concepts and also runs on the JVM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of the support systems are already in place within the IRS to update and manage Java systems. Except for the code, our systems will appear no different. They will use common Java libraries, common java tools, and require the same sorts of maintenance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding Python/Node/Ruby, the ADR is tough but fair:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to have to go through open source package management nightmares in a production application</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="on-deciding-against-microservices-for-the-data-import-systemhttpsgithubcomirs-publicdirect-fileblobmaindocsadrdata-import-systemmd">On <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file/blob/main/docs/adr/data-import-system.md">deciding against microservices for the data import system</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Philosophically this works, but it adds a lot of failure points for very little gain at our current scale and set up</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like to hear a solid reason why breaking this into multiple applications is worthwhile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shout out to the old <em>Software Architecture: The Hard Parts</em> book club at Trello!</p>

			 <p>Really enjoyed this <a href="https://chrisgiven.com/2025/06/saying-goodbye/">post from Chris Given</a> about the history of the IRS <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/8861/IRS%20DF%20FLYER%202025_ENG.pdf">Direct File service</a>, and a lot of it matches my own experience on the 2015-2017 era <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/">USAspending.gov</a> project. Especially the part about assembling the team, which of course is the most important aspect of any large and &ldquo;doomed to fail&rdquo; undertaking.</p>
<p>Nothing but admiration for the Direct File team, who came back from the dead several times to prove‒once again‒that the government can deliver great software.</p>
<p>Thanks for showing how it&rsquo;s done, and thanks for the wise words:</p>

			 <p>Much has been written about GitHub&rsquo;s enshittification and problematic predominance. But from a strictly practical perspective, GitHub remains an important tool for small, open-source research teams. All the code and people are there, and the cost of switching is high.</p>
<p>During the past year, I&rsquo;ve also discovered that GitHub provides access to security tooling that would normally be out of reach for this kind of team. Small groups with limited software engineering bandwidth don&rsquo;t have time to configure and maintain things like automated code and dependency scanning. But they <em>can</em> go to their GitHub organization&rsquo;s security settings and turn on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/applying-the-github-recommended-security-configuration-in-your-organization#about-the-github-recommended-security-configuration">GitHub&rsquo;s recommended security settings</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/applying-the-github-recommended-security-configuration-in-your-organization">Push a few buttons</a>, and once a week your repos are scanned for potential code vulnerabilities and vulnerable dependencies. When a repo needs attention, a notification appears in its <em>Security</em> tag. That&rsquo;s it!</p>
<p>For example, GitHub flagged this example workflow file as vulnerable:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="color:#f92672">name</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">run-code-checks</span>

</a> and incorporate them into the team&rsquo;s development and code review standards.</p>
<p>You can go above and beyond the baseline security configuration (for example, setting up automated PRs for outdated dependencies<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>), but the built-in recommendations are a good place to start if the alternative is doing nothing⎼especially if you&rsquo;re writing software for external users.</p>

			 <p>Today is one of those perfect spring college campus days. The trees are flowering, the sky is blue, and every open space is filled with students enjoying the sunshine.</p>
<p>I’m writing this while sitting in one of the many Adirondack chairs scattered around the lawns. Someone is blaring country music, Rhinestone Cowboy. I’m not sure how—what is the 2025 equivalent of a boom box?</p>
<p>Anyway, I just turned in my UMass laptop because my job here was largely CDC-funded. There’s a good chance the grants will work out, and I hope they do. But in the meantime, I have a family to support and can’t really wait around to find out.</p>
<p>[we’ve moved on to Dancing Queen, and now there is singing—some things never change]</p>
<p>I’m lucky. I had the time for an orderly wrap-up and the time to find a job I’m really excited about.</p>
<p>But I’m still mad. For myself, because I had more to do here, for my erstwhile colleagues who are seeing their life’s work maligned and threatened, for the guy sending the voice of Elvis across the steps of the campus center, for all of us.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m wrapping up an eighteen month stint as a research fellow/research engineer at the University of Massachusetts. Specifically in the <a href="https://reichlab.io/people">Reich Lab</a>, a research team within the School of Public Health&rsquo;s Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology.</p>
<p>After six-ish years at a tech company, academia was quite the culture shift. A few former colleagues have asked about making the transition, so what follows are some 100% personal thoughts about the work (which I loved).</p>
<p>Unlike engineering at a company that sells software, research engineering is a supporting role—a means to an end. You&rsquo;re on someone&rsquo;s grant to help them accomplish their research objectives.</p>
<p>No one will open a JIRA ticket with a user story about tracking MAU. Instead, the smartest people you&rsquo;ve ever met will walk into your office and start writing on the white board. If there&rsquo;s no white board, they&rsquo;ll grab your pen and start writing in your notebook.</p>
<p>Sometimes the problems that need solving are in familiar territory: optimizing code, moving things to the cloud, GitHub security. And sometimes the problems that need solving are miles out of your comfort zone, like applying past versions of a SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree to the latest batch of available genome sequences. If you don&rsquo;t have the background to jump in immediately, your colleagues are generous and patient teachers.</p>
<p>Your communication skills will improve because you&rsquo;re no longer on an engineer-only team, and you can&rsquo;t fall back on engineering jargon to explain your work. Your technical skills will improve because you&rsquo;re working under a different set of constraints.</p>
<p>Peer review is ingrained in academia. LGTM is not a thing, so you&rsquo;ll start writing clearer documentation, issues, and commit messages. You&rsquo;ll get questions that force you to sharpen your thinking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no product owner, micro services platform, logging service, event pipeline, identity management, or security team. Tech titles like staff and principal don&rsquo;t mean anything. You can make yourself valuable by going broad, encouraging industry practices where they help, and letting them go when they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next is exciting, but I&rsquo;m beyond grateful for everything I learned at UMass and the brilliant people I met there. See y&rsquo;all at the Blue Wall!</p>

			 <p>One of my money rules is to prioritize spending it on the things you want to see in the world.</p>
<p>About a year ago, someone somewhere on the internet boosted a post about <a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/">Clarkesworld Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Magazine</a> and some of the publication&rsquo;s recent troubles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having to temporarily shut off submissions due to a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/24/1159286436/ai-chatbot-chatgpt-magazine-clarkesworld-artificial-intelligence">deluge of AI-generated stories</a></li>
<li>Amazon&rsquo;s decision to <a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/clarke_09_23/">stop selling magazine subscriptions via Kindle Newsstand​</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Even though I hadn&rsquo;t heard of Clarkesworld, I impulsed joined its <a href="https://www.patreon.com/clarkesworld">Patreon</a> and now, for the price of a streaming service, an actual, physical magazine arrives in the mail each month<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s an event! My son knows what the Clarkesworld mailer looks like and insists on being the one to open it so we can look at the gorgeous cover art together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a comforting ritual for uncertain times. I&rsquo;m behind on the stories, but the magazines-in-waiting look so beautiful on the shelf—future escapes and a reminder that we can have nice things.</p>

			 <p>Many years ago, I was part of a team that designed a data standard now used throughout the federal government.</p>
<p>We created most of the data standard by passing an Excel spreadsheet around via e-mail. That process worked remarkably well, because the people with the deepest domain knowledge–the people who were absolutely critical to the effort–were comfortable working in spreadsheets.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m making good on the threat to write about the opinions that inform <a href="https://beckysweger.com/2025/02/24/pyprefab-if-you-need-to.html">pyprefab</a>, a command line interface that generates Python package scaffolding.</p>
<p>To be honest, avoiding the doomscroll is part of the motivation for noodling around on this project. But I also really like having pyprefab as a central place to codify my project setup opinions, knowing that every change will be easily incorporated into future work.</p>
<p>One practice I&rsquo;ve come to appreciate is including a <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> document in every project, even if I&rsquo;m the only contributor. Every package created via <a href="https://bsweger.github.io/pyprefab/">pyprefab</a> gets one because I say so.</p>
<h2 id="cyclical-coding">Cyclical coding</h2>
<p>My non-work coding habits are very cyclical. New England winters are good for writing a bunch of Python and learning what&rsquo;s new, summers less so. I&rsquo;m writing this during sugaring season, which means mud season is coming up, along with the spring peepers and baseball. Finally, finally the world will start turning green, and spending free time with the laptop will be less appealing.</p>
<p>Inevitably, the pendulum will swing back, and I&rsquo;ll return to an old project and wonder&hellip;how did that <code>.venv</code> get there? Are we doing the lockfile thing or using pip-compile to generate a requirements.txt? And what is that incantation for previewing the docs? <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> will be there with the answers.</p>

			 <p>The world doesn&rsquo;t need another Python app generator, but I made one anyway. It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyprefab/">pyprefab</a>, and it&rsquo;s a little cli that prompts for a few pieces of information and then creates a Python package that&rsquo;s ready to go (<em>e.g.</em>, script entry point, test suite, Sphinx docs, configured logs).</p>
<p>Beyond having a way to quickly stand up new Python projects just the way I like &lsquo;em, my goals for working on pyprefab are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always worked on internal Python apps and wanted more experience releasing packages to PyPI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using an app instead of, say, writing a <a href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">cookiecutter</a> template makes it easier to test the boilerplate packages being created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wanted something easily shareable at work. We&rsquo;ve already confirmed that uv <a href="https://beckysweger.com/2025/01/23/more-machines-more-python-setup.html">works on everyone&rsquo;s machine</a>, so now people can use <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/">uv tools</a> + pyprefab to spin up a new app without explicitly installing anything else:</p>
<p><code>uvx pyprefab</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>pyprefab is opinionated, so I&rsquo;ll probably write about some of those opinions in the future.</p>

<p>bootstrapping in Python is the root of all evil. By bootstrapping, I mean provisioning Python itself, and configuring a new project so that you can later on install dependencies or build a package. Most problems you have down the road (E.G: packaging problems) actually stem from this</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from <a href="https://www.bitecode.dev/p/a-year-of-uv-pros-cons-and-should">Kevin Samuel, A year of uv: pros, cons, and should you migrate</a></p>
<p>After working as a data engineer at a tech company for nearly six years, on a team composed of software developers who all have the same zippy laptop and the luxury of knowing in advance where their code is going to run, I&rsquo;d almost forgotten about Python&rsquo;s bootstrapping challenges. After starting a new job on a small academic team, I had to remember pretty quickly.</p>
<p>So much of the above article resonates with my recent experience of devising Python setup notes for a team of people with different operating systems who don&rsquo;t have administrative access to their machines.</p>
<p>A delightful, highly-opinionated read about various Python pitfalls, their history, and how <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> can solve nearly all of them.</p>

			 <p>Working in the open has many upsides, one of which is the ability to share stories about a project without revealing anything proprietary.</p>
<p>So this is a story about the software project that culminated in the 2017 relaunch of <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/">usaspending.gov</a>.  Not only was the code open source (<a href="https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency">it still is</a>), but our JIRA tickets were open to all, and we had a website for collaborating with the public and other feds to <a href="https://beckysweger.com/2025/03/26/excel-for-data-standards.html">develop the data standards</a> that power the site.</p>
<p>My time as the 18F technical lead on that project is a career highlight, and it&rsquo;s been on my mind as usaspending.gov and all federal data are getting attention. Feeling an urge to archive, I recently checked to see if the usaspending backend database is still available to the public. <a href="https://onevoicecrm.my.site.com/usaspending/s/database-download">It is</a>!</p>
<p>Having that PostgreSQL archive is important right now, but the original reason for making it available was a creative workaround to a software delivery conundrum.</p>
<p>The law behind an expanded and improved usaspending.gov (the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/994">DATA Act</a>) mandated an implementation no later than May 2017. The team was maybe a sprint away from this deadline when we found a data aggregation bug that caused some incorrect totals on the test website. It was a relatively straightforward problem and absolutely fixable in the remaining time before launch.</p>
<p>However, making that fix would mean no time to implement the last remaining &ldquo;must have&rdquo; feature before going live: a way to download the site&rsquo;s data. Providing the ability to download search results was not only a critical capability⎻it was something promised on the project&rsquo;s road map.</p>
<p>And deviating from that roadmap would have been a sign of failure to the many people who believed that a government-wide, agile, open data software development project could not succeed.</p>
<p>So we faced that classic software delivery quandry: can&rsquo;t move the date, can&rsquo;t change the scope.</p>
<p>We obviously prioritized fixing the data bug. As for providing a data download feature, someone on the team had the idea to contact AWS, who made a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/announcing-usaspending-gov-on-an-amazon-rds-snapshot/">snapshot of our PostgreSQL database available as part of their open data program</a> in time for launch.¹</p>
<p>Not a user-friendly download capability², but a download capability nonetheless. And that&rsquo;s the original reason for publishing a usaspending.gov database snapshot.</p>
<p>¹ It&rsquo;s not on AWS anymore, but the announcement page lives on!<br>
² A more traditional data download feature quickly followed the website&rsquo;s launch.</p>

			 <p>After working at a large tech company for nearly six years, I was unprepared for how spoiled I&rsquo;d gotten when working on teams with uniform technology. Teams where everyone is admin on their corporate-issued laptops all running the same OS. Teams where 85% of software engineers use the same IDE.</p>
<p>Within that kind of environment, if you write instructions for setting up and contributing to a Python project, those instructions will almost certainly work on everyone else&rsquo;s machine.</p>

<li>Conda edited .bashrc and stuck its base Python environment at the beginning of $PATH</li>

			 <p>Life with <code>uv run</code> is going well. The <a href="https://beckysweger.com/2025/01/06/change-your-life-with-uv.html">aforementioned smart, busy colleagues who mostly program in R</a> have <code>uv</code> installed on their machines and the shared Python scripts are flowing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re now ready for Phase 2 of &ldquo;no more Futzing Around™️ with Python.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day, a colleague wants to update an internally-developed Python package. That person may not write a lot of Python, but they can certainly fix a straightforward bug or typo. So they refer to <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> and find the following instructions for creating a dev environment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repo.</li>
<li>Look at <code>.python-version</code> to find out which version of Python we&rsquo;re using for development.</li>
<li>Install pyenv and use pyenv to install the above version of Python.</li>
<li>Create a virtual environment. It’s tempting to skip this step, but please don’t. You can use python, pyenv-virtualenv, poetry, conda, pdm, hatch, pipenv, rye, or uv to create a virtual environment. <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> recommends whatever tool its author likes.</li>
<li>Activate the virtual environment.</li>
<li>Install the package dev dependencies: <code>pip install -r requirements-dev.txt</code></li>
<li>Install the package as an editable module: <code>pip install -e .</code></li>
<li>Before making your change run the tests to ensure all is well: <code>pytest</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Now that everyone on the team has <code>uv</code> installed, you can simplify <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> to something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repo.</li>
<li>Create a virtual environment: <code>uv venv --seed</code>¹</li>
<li>Install the package dev dependencies: <code>uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt</code></li>
<li>Install the package as an editable module: <code>uv pip install -e .</code></li>
<li>Before making your change run the tests to ensure all is well: <code>uv run pytest</code></li>
</ol>
<p>I like this approach for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It removes barriers to entry for potential collaborators.</li>
<li>Yet it doesn&rsquo;t require existing contributors to change the way they work. People are free to handle their own Python installs, virtual environments, and dependencies as they see fit (as long as they generate annotated requirements.txt files when updating dependencies).²</li>
</ol>
<p>¹ <a href="https://beckysweger.com/2025/01/14/seeding-virtual-environments-with-pip.html"><code>--seed</code> tells <code>uv</code> to include seed packages like <code>pip</code> and <code>setuptools</code> in the virtual environment it creates</a>. It&rsquo;s helpful for people who would rather activate the environment instead of prefixing every command with <code>uv run</code> or <code>uv pip</code>.</p>
<p>² Add <code>uv.lock</code> to <code>.gitignore</code> to remove any confusion on this point.</p>

<p>But other muscle memory commands don&rsquo;t work as well, especially those related to <code>pip</code>. By default,  <code>pip</code> isn&rsquo;t installed into uv virtual environments. So you have to do things like <code>uv pip list</code> instead of <code>pip list</code>.</p>
<p>The uv <code>--seed</code> option fixes that by installing <code>pip</code> and other seed packages into the new environment: <code>uv venv --seed</code>.</p>
<p>I ended up aliasing <code>uv venv</code> to <code>uv venv --seed</code> with the following function in ye old <code>.zshrc</code>:¹</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m gonna write about <code>uv run</code> again, because it&rsquo;s just that handy!</p>
<p>Lou Franco <a href="https://mastodon.social/@loufranco/113783255399204720">asked a very good question</a> about the <a href="https://beckysweger.com/2025/01/06/change-your-life-with-uv.html"><code>uv run</code> post from earlier in the week</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is there much that the sharer has to do? (I have a requirements.txt file)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope! Assuming that the script and requirements.txt file are in the same directory (and that the person running the script has uv installed):</p>
<p><code>uv run --with-requirements requirements.txt very-useful-script.py</code></p>
<p>You could also <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies">embed the requirements in the script itself</a>. Or install dependencies from <code>pyproject.toml</code> Or use an index other than PyPI. Or load some environment variables before running the script. It&rsquo;s all here: <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run">https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the great things about uv. You can use it to manage an entire Python project, but you don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to: just pick and choose what you need.</p>
<p>P.S. Lou <a href="https://loufranco.com/">has a blog</a> and is <a href="https://loufranco.com/tech-debt-book">writing a book about tech debt</a>. You should read them!</p>

			 <p>Imagine that your colleagues—very smart, busy people who mostly program in R—need a dataset that&rsquo;s difficult to create. And they want the ability to recreate the dataset as often as necessary. The freedom to tweak the code and experiment with the inputs.</p>

<p>Good news! You have a script that does exactly what they need. It&rsquo;s written in Python instead of R, but anyone can run it by following these simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Python. Python is already on your laptop, but don&rsquo;t use that one. Install a different Python. Actually, just install pyenv and then use pyenv to install Python.</li>
<li>Create a virtual environment. It&rsquo;s tempting to skip this step, but please don&rsquo;t. You can use python, pyenv-virtualenv, poetry, conda, pdm, hatch, pipenv, rye, or uv to create a virtual environment. I will make a recommendation. Next month I will make a different recommendation.</li>
<li>Activate your virtual environment.</li>
<li>The script uses polars, biopython, and zstandard, so use pip to install those dependencies. Don&rsquo;t install polars 1.17.0, everything will break.</li>
<li>Run the script: <code>python very-useful-script.py</code></li>

			 <p>Skipping GitHub action jobs on forked repos is a surprisingly hard thing to Google. Most advice says to:</p>
<ul>
<li>disable workflows on the forked repo</li>
<li>hard-code a check for the repo&rsquo;s owner name to determine whether or not it&rsquo;s a fork</li>
</ul>
<p>But I work on a <a href="https://github.com/reichlab/variant-nowcast-hub">repository at Day Job™️</a> that has many workflows, some of which are useful to external contributors who fork. Also, why give people manual instructions for something a computer can check?</p>
<p>Secondly, the workflow in question is derived from a template used by other repository owners in our ecosystem. Ideally, there would be a solution that doesn&rsquo;t hard-code an owner name (so we can update the template itself).</p>
<p>After following <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/github-actions/dump-context">this advice from Simon Willison</a> about dumping the GitHub actions context, I stumbled upon <code>github.event.repository.fork</code> 🎉</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what it looks like in practice—the job below will not run on a fork:</p>

<p>So I moved everything to micro.blog, which lets you write in markdown while using a hosted service, so you don&rsquo;t have to upgrade hugo and remember how it works and submit a pull request whenever you want to write something.</p>
<p>Also, it is my fervent hope that having a &ldquo;micro&rdquo; blog will silence the nagging voice insisting that each post must be a carefully crafted, highly-edited endeavor.</p>
<p>2025 is the year of blogging&ndash;for real this time!</p>

<p>In less than two weeks, after years of discussion, my husband and I are moving away from Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s a terrible time to leave good jobs and find new ones, and it’s not the best time to sell a house. We have no friends or family in our new town. But the time is now.</p>
<p>I truly and deeply love Philly. However, for many reasons—some related to the city, and some related to us—I know it’s not our forever home.</p>
<p>After spending the last month of my father’s life in Lititz with my family, I witnessed the importance of community and the forever home. I saw the same thing again in Galloway, NJ after Nana died. The forever home is more than an investment, more than a five year plan. And community is so much more than acquaintances, loose connections, and professional networks.</p>
<p>After a lot of research (and a spreadsheet, of course), we decided to relocate to Northampton, Massachusetts. The Pioneer Valley has everything we could want from nature (rivers, lakes, trees, and mountains), and Northampton has most things we could want from a town (thriving retail, restaurants, theaters, and music venues).  My new job is local and promises to be challenging and interesting.</p>
<p>Taking the leap without a bridge is hard, but the house, jobs, and other details fell into place after we committed to the change. Because why wait?</p>
<p>Thanks to Wharton Computing for 5 ½ years of opportunity. It’s a great place to work and a tough place to leave.</p>
<p>And goodbye to the Philadelphia characters and friends we’ve met over the years through blogs, neighborhood dramas, work, clubs, and just wandering around this great city of ours. Walking away from you after 15 years is downright heartbreaking.</p>

<p>For the last four months, I’ve been having a love affair with the Kindle 3.  It’s a sleek companion, and with the push of a button it can deliver a whole universe of books and magazines.</p>
<p>And it’s easy.  Easy to carry, easy on the eyes, and easy to use.</p>
<p>But the Kindle ecosystem reminds me of another product that makes it easy to access digital content—iTunes.  When iTunes came along those many years ago, it was so fun to download one-hit wonders from the 80s and to grab albums that the much-cooler-than-me girl across the hall listened to in college.</p>
<p>The geeks complaining about DRM were just chatter in the background of my new-found music.</p>
<p>But now I regret spending money on content that’s locked to a single family of devices and can’t be shared with the rest of the household.  Which raises the question:  a few years from now, will I have the same regrets about Kindle purchases?</p>

I think of Schwartz’s maximizers and satisficers whenever I’m paralyzed by many choices in, say, the toothpaste aisle of Target.</p>
<p>But what if you’re not in the toothpaste aisle of Target?  What if you’re on Amazon.com and can choose from millions of book?  Or you’re facing a feed reader with thousands of unread items?  Assuming that funds and time are finite, how do you choose?</p>
<p>It’s no longer a matter of choosing the first option that meets your needs.  We need to pre-screen and remove the cognitive load of irrelevant options altogether, either through a human curator or an algorithm.</p>
<p>When I tell people about our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200920134519/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture" title="Wikipedia: community supported agriculture">community supported agriculture</a> (CSA) membership, the first question is usually, “is pre-paying for a season of farm food cheaper than buying it at the store?”</p>
<p>Frankly, I have no idea.  This is the wrong question.  We’re paying first and foremost to support local farmers, but we’re also paying the folks of Greensgrow (our local urban farm) to build relationships with growers and choose the week’s produce.  We pay them to make sure each delivery has leafy greens, veggies, fruit, and cheese.  In other words, we pay them to curate our food, and it’s a great investment.</p>

			 <p>I’m finishing up a small project that required validating dollar amounts on web-based form fields, and luckily I was using the Validation jQuery plugin.</p>
<p>Although this plugin doesn’t come with an out-of-the-box dollar validator method, it’s easy to add your own. The trick was to find an appropriate regular expression. Although Google turned up several regex examples for validating dollar inputs, none met my exact criteria (the ultimate goal being to provide users with the greatest amount of data-entry leeway):</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow the user to type in the <em>$</em> (or not)</li>
<li>Allow amounts less than one dollar (<em>i.e.</em>, 0 – .99)</li>
<li>Allow an optional one or two decimal places</li>
<li>No negative dollar amounts</li>
</ul>
<p>So this is what I came up with, and it seems to be working. Two notes: (a) this expression allows inappropriate commas, but I’m stripping those out during the server-side validations, and (b) it is used in conjunction with the <em>max()</em> validator function to ensure the user doesn’t enter anything that could blow up a SQL Server money column:</p>

<p>A few colleagues have had positive experiences using the <a href="https://github.com/swiz/swiz-framework">Swiz framework</a> for Flex applications.</p>
<p>I haven’t used Flex frameworks in the past because a) I was still learning Flex and wasn’t ready to throw a framework into the mix and b) the only real option was Cairngorm, which seemed like complete overkill.</p>
<p>Now that I’m more comfortable with Flex and understand some of its limitations, however, I can endorse Swiz.</p>
<p>Swiz doesn’t impose a strict structure, and it solves actual problems.  Even if you don’t care about separating your model from your views or abstracting service calls, Swiz is worth investigating for these reasons:</p>
<p><strong>Event Handling:</strong> You can dispatch events at will and add the corresponding event listeners where required.  You don’t have to worry about the fact the Flex events bubble up and not down—Swiz just takes care of it.</p>
<p><strong>Command Chains</strong>:  It’s often the case that Flex remote object calls need to occur in a particular sequence or that a series of remote object calls needs to complete before moving on to the next piece of code.  The logic required to ensure everything happens in the right order can get messy and only gets worse over time.  Swiz allows you to define a series of commands (called a <em>CommandChain</em>) and execute them together (sequentially or in parallel).</p>
<p>The Swiz Google code page and the Swiz Framework site have some instructions for getting started with Swiz.  The code samples are piecemeal and outdated, however, so I created a small project that demonstrates basic Swiz functions.  It’s a pretty silly app, but I created it so the Wharton Computing developer community could reference some well-commented code that works in our environment.</p>
<p>Because the back-end services are written in ColdFusion and it’s not especially practical to invest in CF hosting just to demo this, what you see here is a static screenshot.</p>

			 <p>Part of my job is moonlighting as a SQL Server database admin, so a co-worker recently asked me to run a script against a production table. The task was simple: add a few new columns and create some indexes. He had generated the script by using SQL Server 2008 Management Studio’s (SSMS) Generate Change Script function.</p>
<p>Although the general sequence of steps in the generated script made sense, I have some complaints about the SSMS output. Here’s a very simple recreation of the scenario.</p>
<p>Consider a table with two columns. One is a primary key, and one has a default constraint:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>In this scenario, changes that occurred prior to the error will be rolled back. However, although the RETURN statement exits the current batch, subsequent batches (for example, the one that deletes your table) will execute.</p>
<p>A TRY/CATCH block is another potential error-handling method, but TRY/CATCH blocks can’t span multiple batches.</p>
<p>So what’s with the batch-happy SSMS? In older versions of SQL it might have been necessary to separate a <code>CREATE TABLE</code> and subsequent <code>ALTER TABLE</code> statements into separate batches (I haven’t tested this). But SQL 2005 and 2008 provide statement-level recompilation, so the multitude of batches isn&rsquo;t necessary.</p>
<p>A “GO-less” version of the script handled errors swimmingly. It’s understandable that SSMS can’t generate the error-handling, but if it would reduce the scripts’ number of batches to the minimum required, it would be easier to add the error handling yourself.</p>
<p>Conclusion: don’t rely on these SQL Server Management Studio-generated change scripts for any serious work, and definitely don’t use them as a model for how to write robust T-SQL.</p>

			 <p>Serving as an alternate juror is one of life’s more frustrating exercises. It’s all the inconvenience of attending the trial and none of the decision making. In terms of actual hours worked, however, it’s an easy job:  arrive at 9:30, start working at 10 or 10:30, take a two hour lunch, and leave by 4:30. This schedule leaves plenty of room for deep thoughts.</p>
<p>Our judge instructed us not to take notes—we had to sit in the jury box without the aid of external mnemonic devices, which seemed like an impediment that could well lead to a travesty of justice.</p>
<p>I found the opposite to be true, though. When was the last time you sat in a room without phones, newspapers, iPods, or conversations and just actively listened? It’s the freedom to find the truth by not only listening but by studying clues like body language, demeanor, and facial expressions, which you can’t do when your head is buried in a notebook. There’s a place for conversations, questions, and notes, but it’s during deliberations, when twelve people bring their individual observations to the jury room and render a verdict.</p>
<p>Outside of the courtroom, we spend a lot of time and money to go places and do things, only to cheat ourselves by not paying attention.  It’s become more important to broadcast and perfectly capture our trips, conferences, and nights out than to live them. What contextual information do we miss when live-tweeting a keynote address?  How can we form mature, thoughtful, and independent judgments in a world of chatter and soundbytes? Information might be free, but knowledge and wisdom require a price, part of which is knowing when to listen.</p>

<p>After some digging around, we found the underlying cause of the error:  the <code>CASE</code> statement return values have different data types.  In some cases, returning different data types will behave as expected.  However, mixing numeric and character data causes problems.</p>
<p>In the statement above, gameId, groupID, roundSent, and groupMessageID are integers, sentOn is a datetime, and messageID is a uniqueidentifier.  Because the data type precedence pecking order in this case is datetime, int, and then uniqueidentifier, SQL choose datetime as the return type. Uniqueidentifiers cannot be converted to datetimes, hence the error message.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>At two recent code reviews, we’ve discussed the use of SQL Server auto-incrementing fields as primary keys. Using system-generated numbers to uniquely identify rows (<em>i.e.</em>, implementing <em>surrogate keys</em>) is a good practice* because it reduces the likelihood of errors introduced by bad data. However, these surrogate keys are meaningless and exist only for the purpose of identification.</p>
<p>The problem is that many applications do not treat surrogate keys as meaningless numbers, a practice that reduces portability. Consider a lookup table that lists an application’s user roles. The most basic structure for such a table would be two columns: <code>role_id</code> and <code>role_name</code>:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>role_id</th>
<th>role_name</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>student</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>faculty</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>TA</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>admin</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Many applications would do the following to get a list of faculty users:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span style="color:#66d9ef">SELECT</span> user_name <span style="color:#66d9ef">FROM</span> tblRole <span style="color:#66d9ef">WHERE</span> rold_id <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>
</code></pre></div><p>However, there’s no guarantee that the faculty role will be assigned to the id of 2 in perpetuity. 2 doesn’t mean faculty, it just means 2. If you reload your data and port the application to another environment, the faculty role id might be 4 or 10 or 33,288.</p>
<p>It’s safer to look up the <code>role_id</code> where <code>role_name</code> = ‘faculty’ and use that value instead of assuming 2. This method, of course, would create problems if the application users decide to change the name of the ‘faculty’ role to ‘instructor.’ A better solution is to create more descriptive lookup tables that support front-end changes while also maintaining meaningless surrogate keys:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>role_id</th>
<th>role_code</th>
<th>role_name</th>
<th>role_sort_order</th>
<th>role_create_date</th>
<th>role_update_date</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>s</td>
<td>student</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>10/31/2007</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>f</td>
<td>faculty</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>10/31/2007</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>t</td>
<td>TA</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>10/31/2007</td>
<td>11/03/2008</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>admin</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>10/31/2007</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This table structure allows you to get the faculty surrogate key by querying for <code>role_code</code> = ‘f’. The <code>role_name</code> field is what users see and can be modified without breaking the application. Finally, <code>role_sort_order</code> controls the front-end display order of these items and allows you to change the sort order without touching any code.</p>

		<a href="https://beckysweger.com/2007/04/02/using-eclipse-and-ant-for.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2007-04-02 19:00:00 -0500">Apr 2, 2007</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Recently the <a href="https://simulations.wharton.upenn.edu/">Wharton Learning Lab</a> has been discussing ways to do team development as we transition to Flex 2 and the Eclipse IDE. We’re starting a project now that will involve four developers, so we’ll need to keep our own working copies of the project. Not an earth-shattering idea, but it’s new for us–we usually share a single code base during development.</p>
<p>A colleague with the most Eclipse experience in the group suggested that <a href="https://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>, a java-based build tool, could be used to make the team development process smoother. Because Ant ships with Eclipse and because Adobe recently released custom <a href="https://flex.apache.org/flexunit/asdoc/anttasks/index.html">Flex Ant tasks</a>, in theory it should be possible to create an Ant script that will mimic the default Flex build process and also perform extra tasks such as moving files around.</p>
<p>In practice, however, it’s not easy to create such a script if you’re new to Flex 2, Eclipse, and Ant because the documentation is scattered between all three products (as well as some blogs). So I munged the available information into a single “how to.” The steps below show how to implement a very basic Ant build script that will copy Flex code from the “master” code base to your working area, compile it, and create the swf html wrappers.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you’re using the stand-alone version of Flex Builder, follow these directions to set up the Ant environment: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150207014026/http://www.peterelst.com/blog/2006/09/03/flex-builder-2-ant-support/">http://www.peterelst.com/blog/2006/09/03/flex-builder-2-ant-support/</a>. Skip this step if you’re using the plug-in version of Flex Builder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the Flex Ant tasks from Adobe Labs and follow the installation instructions: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150207014026/http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flex_Ant_Tasks">http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flex_Ant_Tasks</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The instructions say to copy the flexTasks.jar file to “Ant’s lib directory.” I put my files in the locations below, which seems to work fine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand-alone: C:Program FilesAdobeFlex Builder 2plugins</li>
<li>Eclipse plug-in: C:Program FilesEclipsepluginsorg.apache.ant_1.6.5lib</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Open your Eclipse Flex project and add a build file to it. An Ant build file is an XML document that contains a series of tasks called “targets.” A sample build file template is attached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify the build file template to work with your current project. The only things you should need to change are the properties (<em>i.e.</em>, variables) at the top of the file:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>FLEX_HOME</code>: points to the location of your Flex SDK. By default this location is C:\Program Files\AdobeFlex Builder 2\Flex SDK 2 for the standalone version of Flex Builder and C:\Program Files\AdobeFlex Builder 2\Plug-in\Flex SDK 2 for the plug-in.</li>
<li><code>DEPLOY_DIR</code>: the folder that will contain your Flex executables (<em>i.e.</em>, the swf and its corresponding html wrappers)</li>
<li><code>MAIN_APP_ROOT</code>: the location of the project’s “master” code base</li>
<li><code>WORKING_APP_ROOT</code>: the location of your working folder</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the Eclipse Ant window: <em>Window–&gt;Other Views</em> (select Ant from the <em>Show View</em> window).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the Ant window is open in your Eclipse workspace, add your build file (see screenshot below):</p>
<ul>
<li>In the upper-right hand corner of the Ant window, click the <em>Add Buildfiles</em> button (<em>i.e</em>., the button with the picture of an ant).</li>
<li>From the <em>Buildfile Selection</em> window, choose your build file and click OK.</li>
<li>You should now see your build file displayed in the Ant window. You can expand the individual tasks (<em>i.e.</em>, targets).</li>
<li>You should be able to execute the individual tasks in the script by double-clicking them. Output will appear on the console.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is as far as I’ve gotten. I’ve been using the built-in Flex compiler when working in my sandbox and the Ant script to get the latest code updates from the main project folder.</p>
<p>It seems like a lot of work just to copy files around, but once the initial setup is complete it’s a handy way to avoid manually pushing updates from SourceSafe and potentially overwriting changes. No doubt there’s much cooler things you can do with Ant–if anyone has any tricks, please share!</p>

			 <p>Dynamic SQL came up again at a recent code review.  If only for your own maintenance sanity, it’s worth eliminating dynamic SQL where possible, but there are times you can’t avoid it (for example, some implementations of the new SQL 2005 <code>PIVOT</code> function). If you must do the dynamic SQL thing, there are two ways to accomplish it:</p>
<ul>
<li>EXEC(@stringofsql)</li>
<li>sp_executesql @stringofsql, @someparameters</li>
</ul>
<p>The first option is old school, but it still works. <code>sp_executesql</code>, however, is newer and allows you to use parameters in conjunction with the dymanically-built SQL string.</p>
<p>Having the option to use parameters is a great improvement–if the parameters are the only part of the SQL command that changes, the optimizer can reuse the execution plan instead of generating a new one each time the code is run. See SQL Server Books Online for the exact <code>sp_executesql</code> syntax.</p>

			 <p>Recently I encountered a SQL Server error-handling trap that caused a transaction not to roll back as expected. The code was issuing two insert statements that were grouped into a single transaction:</p>

<span style="color:#66d9ef">COMMIT</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">TRANSACTION</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The above error-handling works most of the time. However, if there&rsquo;s a run-time T-SQL error (for example, a missing object or a divide by 0 error), the offending statement fails but the rest of the transaction executes. In my case, the second insert failed because Table2 had been renamed. The subsequent @error check was never invoked, so the first insert wasn’t rolled back.</p>
<p>This behavior can be overridden by setting <code>SET XACT_ABORT</code> to ON, which specifies that the current transaction will automatically roll back in the event of a T-SQL run-time error.</p>
