			 <p>The <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public">newly-released source code</a> for<a href="https://directfile.irs.gov"> IRS Direct File</a> is a truly important artifact for:</p>
<ul>
<li>anyone who has tried to express the U.S. tax code programmatically</li>
<li>anyone interested in how teams make technical decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The former group should check out the <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file/blob/main/docs/engineering/tax-flow/Tax_Code_to_Factgraph.pdf">Fact Graph</a>, which deserves its own post (IRS DAG, anyone?).</p>
<p>For the latter, the repo&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file/tree/main/docs">docs directory</a> has all kinds of rare treats. If you&rsquo;ve ever worked in government, you know how hard it is to publish <em>anything</em>, let alone something that describes your thinking or lessons learned. Much respect to the Direct File team for including artifacts about ther research and decisions.</p>
<p>The themes of the project&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file/tree/main/docs/adr">architectural decision records</a> (ADRs) are pragmatism and simplicity. Which isn&rsquo;t to say that Direct File is simple. My impression is that the team simply chose to spend more time on unsolved problems (<em>e.g.</em>, representing the tax code as a graph) and less time on solved problems (databases).</p>
<p>These ADRs were some of my highlights, but they&rsquo;re all worth reading.</p>
<h3 id="on-simple-databaseshttpsgithubcomirs-publicdirect-fileblobmaindocsadradr_user_supplied_infomd">On simple <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file/blob/main/docs/adr/adr_user_supplied_info.md">databases</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The data we are planning to store is not so large as to cause a problem for any common RDBMS provider. There won&rsquo;t be any particular slowdown or read issues associated with reading the data out of the database.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We can architect around having the database be a single point of failure in our system&hellip; If our database system does go completely down, our system will go down as well. Introducing another system doesn&rsquo;t solve that problem, and it in fact compounds the problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> They went with Postgres</p>
<h3 id="on-choosing-programming-languageshttpsgithubcomirs-publicdirect-fileblobmaindocsadradr-languagemd">On <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file/blob/main/docs/adr/adr-language.md">choosing programming languages</a></h3>
<p>I confess to pouting a bit after realizing that DIrect File is Java-heavy, which is why I really appreciated this ADR.</p>
<p>In addition to noting that the IRS is already a Java shop, the document lists a number of other <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file/blob/main/docs/adr/adr-language.md#technical-questions">technical considerations</a>, many of which aren&rsquo;t obvious to someone without tax domain experience. For example, Direct File needs a language that works well with WSDL/SOAP because that&rsquo;s the basis of the electronic filing system it integrates with (<a href="https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/modernized-e-file-program-information">IRS Modernized e-File system</a>).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a lot of Scala in Direct File, which seems like a strange choice for government. However, Scala has strong support for graph concepts and also runs on the JVM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of the support systems are already in place within the IRS to update and manage Java systems. Except for the code, our systems will appear no different. They will use common Java libraries, common java tools, and require the same sorts of maintenance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding Python/Node/Ruby, the ADR is tough but fair:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to have to go through open source package management nightmares in a production application</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="on-deciding-against-microservices-for-the-data-import-systemhttpsgithubcomirs-publicdirect-fileblobmaindocsadrdata-import-systemmd">On <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file/blob/main/docs/adr/data-import-system.md">deciding against microservices for the data import system</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Philosophically this works, but it adds a lot of failure points for very little gain at our current scale and set up</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like to hear a solid reason why breaking this into multiple applications is worthwhile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shout out to the old <em>Software Architecture: The Hard Parts</em> book club at Trello!</p>

			 <p>Really enjoyed this <a href="https://chrisgiven.com/2025/06/saying-goodbye/">post from Chris Given</a> about the history of the IRS <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/inflation-reduction-act/irs-direct-file-service">Direct File service</a>, and a lot of it matches my own experience on the 2015-2017 era <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/">USAspending.gov</a> project. Especially the part about assembling the team, which of course is the most important aspect of any large and &ldquo;doomed to fail&rdquo; undertaking.</p>
<p>Nothing but admiration for the Direct File team, who came back from the dead several times to prove‒once again‒that the government can deliver great software.</p>
<p>Thanks for showing how it&rsquo;s done, and thanks for the wise words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>whatever you do, don’t try to express the logic of the Internal Revenue Code as YAML</p>

			 <p>Much has been written about GitHub&rsquo;s enshittification and problematic predominance. But from a strictly practical perspective, GitHub remains an important tool for small, open-source research teams. All the code and people are there, and the cost of switching is high.</p>
<p>During the past year, I&rsquo;ve also discovered that GitHub provides access to security tooling that would normally be out of reach for this kind of team. Small groups with limited software engineering bandwidth don&rsquo;t have time to configure and maintain things like automated code and dependency scanning. But they <em>can</em> go to their GitHub organization&rsquo;s security settings and turn on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/applying-the-github-recommended-security-configuration-in-your-organization#about-the-github-recommended-security-configuration">GitHub&rsquo;s recommended security settings</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/applying-the-github-recommended-security-configuration-in-your-organization">Push a few buttons</a>, and once a week your repos are scanned for potential code vulnerabilities and vulnerable dependencies. When a repo needs attention, a notification appears in its <em>Security</em> tag. That&rsquo;s it!</p>
<p>For example, GitHub flagged this example workflow file as vulnerable:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="color:#f92672">name</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">run-code-checks</span>

<p>Unobstrusive, helpful, and actionable. It also prompted me to read up on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions">best practices for securing GitHub actions
</a> and incorporate them into the team&rsquo;s development and code review standards.</p>
<p>You can go above and beyond the baseline security configuration (for example, setting up automated PRs for outdated dependencies<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>), but the built-in recommendations are a good place to start if the alternative is doing nothing⎼especially if you&rsquo;re writing software for external users.</p>

			 <p>Today is one of those perfect spring college campus days. The trees are flowering, the sky is blue, and every open space is filled with students enjoying the sunshine.</p>
<p>I’m writing this while sitting in one of the many Adirondack chairs scattered around the lawns. Someone is blaring country music, Rhinestone Cowboy. I’m not sure how—what is the 2025 equivalent of a boom box?</p>
<p>Anyway, I just turned in my UMass laptop because my job here was largely CDC-funded. There’s a good chance the grants will work out, and I hope they do. But in the meantime, I have a family to support and can’t really wait around to find out.</p>
<p>[we’ve moved on to Dancing Queen, and now there is singing—some things never change]</p>
<p>I’m lucky. I had the time for an orderly wrap-up and the time to find a job I’m really excited about.</p>
<p>But I’m still mad. For myself, because I had more to do here, for my erstwhile colleagues who are seeing their life’s work maligned and threatened, for the guy sending the voice of Elvis across the steps of the campus center, for all of us.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m wrapping up an eighteen month stint as a research fellow/research engineer at the University of Massachusetts. Specifically in the <a href="https://reichlab.io/people">Reich Lab</a>, a research team within the School of Public Health&rsquo;s Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology.</p>
<p>After six-ish years at a tech company, academia was quite the culture shift. A few former colleagues have asked about making the transition, so what follows are some 100% personal thoughts about the work (which I loved).</p>
<p>Unlike engineering at a company that sells software, research engineering is a supporting role—a means to an end. You&rsquo;re on someone&rsquo;s grant to help them accomplish their research objectives.</p>
<p>No one will open a JIRA ticket with a user story about tracking MAU. Instead, the smartest people you&rsquo;ve ever met will walk into your office and start writing on the white board. If there&rsquo;s no white board, they&rsquo;ll grab your pen and start writing in your notebook.</p>
<p>Sometimes the problems that need solving are in familiar territory: optimizing code, moving things to the cloud, GitHub security. And sometimes the problems that need solving are miles out of your comfort zone, like applying past versions of a SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree to the latest batch of available genome sequences. If you don&rsquo;t have the background to jump in immediately, your colleagues are generous and patient teachers.</p>
<p>Your communication skills will improve because you&rsquo;re no longer on an engineer-only team, and you can&rsquo;t fall back on engineering jargon to explain your work. Your technical skills will improve because you&rsquo;re working under a different set of constraints.</p>
<p>Peer review is ingrained in academia. LGTM is not a thing, so you&rsquo;ll start writing clearer documentation, issues, and commit messages. You&rsquo;ll get questions that force you to sharpen your thinking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no product owner, micro services platform, logging service, event pipeline, identity management, or security team. Tech titles like staff and principal don&rsquo;t mean anything. You can make yourself valuable by going broad, encouraging industry practices where they help, and letting them go when they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next is exciting, but I&rsquo;m beyond grateful for everything I learned at UMass and the brilliant people I met there. See y&rsquo;all at the Blue Wall!</p>

			 <p>One of my money rules is to prioritize spending it on the things you want to see in the world.</p>
<p>About a year ago, someone somewhere on the internet boosted a post about <a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/">Clarkesworld Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Magazine</a> and some of the publication&rsquo;s recent troubles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having to temporarily shut off submissions due to a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/24/1159286436/ai-chatbot-chatgpt-magazine-clarkesworld-artificial-intelligence">deluge of AI-generated stories</a></li>
<li>Amazon&rsquo;s decision to <a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/clarke_09_23/">stop selling magazine subscriptions via Kindle Newsstand​</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Even though I hadn&rsquo;t heard of Clarkesworld, I impulsed joined its <a href="https://www.patreon.com/clarkesworld">Patreon</a> and now, for the price of a streaming service, an actual, physical magazine arrives in the mail each month<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s an event! My son knows what the Clarkesworld mailer looks like and insists on being the one to open it so we can look at the gorgeous cover art together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a comforting ritual for uncertain times. I&rsquo;m behind on the stories, but the magazines-in-waiting look so beautiful on the shelf—future escapes and a reminder that we can have nice things.</p>

			 <p>Many years ago, I was part of a team that designed a data standard now used throughout the federal government.</p>
<p>We created most of the data standard by passing an Excel spreadsheet around via e-mail. That process worked remarkably well, because the people with the deepest domain knowledge–the people who were absolutely critical to the effort–were comfortable working in spreadsheets.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m making good on the threat to write about the opinions that inform <a href="https://beckysweger.com/2025/02/24/pyprefab-if-you-need-to.html">pyprefab</a>, a command line interface that generates Python package scaffolding.</p>
<p>To be honest, avoiding the doomscroll is part of the motivation for noodling around on this project. But I also really like having pyprefab as a central place to codify my project setup opinions, knowing that every change will be easily incorporated into future work.</p>
<p>One practice I&rsquo;ve come to appreciate is including a <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> document in every project, even if I&rsquo;m the only contributor. Every package created via <a href="https://bsweger.github.io/pyprefab/">pyprefab</a> gets one because I say so.</p>
<h2 id="cyclical-coding">Cyclical coding</h2>
<p>My non-work coding habits are very cyclical. New England winters are good for writing a bunch of Python and learning what&rsquo;s new, summers less so. I&rsquo;m writing this during sugaring season, which means mud season is coming up, along with the spring peepers and baseball. Finally, finally the world will start turning green, and spending free time with the laptop will be less appealing.</p>
<p>Inevitably, the pendulum will swing back, and I&rsquo;ll return to an old project and wonder&hellip;how did that <code>.venv</code> get there? Are we doing the lockfile thing or using pip-compile to generate a requirements.txt? And what is that incantation for previewing the docs? <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> will be there with the answers.</p>

			 <p>The world doesn&rsquo;t need another Python app generator, but I made one anyway. It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyprefab/">pyprefab</a>, and it&rsquo;s a little cli that prompts for a few pieces of information and then creates a Python package that&rsquo;s ready to go (<em>e.g.</em>, script entry point, test suite, Sphinx docs, configured logs).</p>
<p>Beyond having a way to quickly stand up new Python projects just the way I like &lsquo;em, my goals for working on pyprefab are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always worked on internal Python apps and wanted more experience releasing packages to PyPI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using an app instead of, say, writing a <a href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">cookiecutter</a> template makes it easier to test the boilerplate packages being created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wanted something easily shareable at work. We&rsquo;ve already confirmed that uv <a href="https://beckysweger.com/2025/01/23/more-machines-more-python-setup.html">works on everyone&rsquo;s machine</a>, so now people can use <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/">uv tools</a> + pyprefab to spin up a new app without explicitly installing anything else:</p>
<p><code>uvx pyprefab</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>pyprefab is opinionated, so I&rsquo;ll probably write about some of those opinions in the future.</p>

<p>bootstrapping in Python is the root of all evil. By bootstrapping, I mean provisioning Python itself, and configuring a new project so that you can later on install dependencies or build a package. Most problems you have down the road (E.G: packaging problems) actually stem from this</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from <a href="https://www.bitecode.dev/p/a-year-of-uv-pros-cons-and-should">Kevin Samuel, A year of uv: pros, cons, and should you migrate</a></p>
<p>After working as a data engineer at a tech company for nearly six years, on a team composed of software developers who all have the same zippy laptop and the luxury of knowing in advance where their code is going to run, I&rsquo;d almost forgotten about Python&rsquo;s bootstrapping challenges. After starting a new job on a small academic team, I had to remember pretty quickly.</p>
<p>So much of the above article resonates with my recent experience of devising Python setup notes for a team of people with different operating systems who don&rsquo;t have administrative access to their machines.</p>
<p>A delightful, highly-opinionated read about various Python pitfalls, their history, and how <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> can solve nearly all of them.</p>

			 <p>Working in the open has many upsides, one of which is the ability to share stories about a project without revealing anything proprietary.</p>
<p>So this is a story about the software project that culminated in the 2017 relaunch of <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/">usaspending.gov</a>.  Not only was the code open source (<a href="https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency">it still is</a>), but our JIRA tickets were open to all, and we had a website for collaborating with the public and other feds to <a href="https://beckysweger.com/2025/03/26/excel-for-data-standards.html">develop the data standards</a> that power the site.</p>
<p>My time as the 18F technical lead on that project is a career highlight, and it&rsquo;s been on my mind as usaspending.gov and all federal data are getting attention. Feeling an urge to archive, I recently checked to see if the usaspending backend database is still available to the public. <a href="https://onevoicecrm.my.site.com/usaspending/s/database-download">It is</a>!</p>
<p>Having that PostgreSQL archive is important right now, but the original reason for making it available was a creative workaround to a software delivery conundrum.</p>
<p>The law behind an expanded and improved usaspending.gov (the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/994">DATA Act</a>) mandated an implementation no later than May 2017. The team was maybe a sprint away from this deadline when we found a data aggregation bug that caused some incorrect totals on the test website. It was a relatively straightforward problem and absolutely fixable in the remaining time before launch.</p>
<p>However, making that fix would mean no time to implement the last remaining &ldquo;must have&rdquo; feature before going live: a way to download the site&rsquo;s data. Providing the ability to download search results was not only a critical capability⎻it was something promised on the project&rsquo;s road map.</p>
<p>And deviating from that roadmap would have been a sign of failure to the many people who believed that a government-wide, agile, open data software development project could not succeed.</p>
<p>So we faced that classic software delivery quandry: can&rsquo;t move the date, can&rsquo;t change the scope.</p>
<p>We obviously prioritized fixing the data bug. As for providing a data download feature, someone on the team had the idea to contact AWS, who made a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/announcing-usaspending-gov-on-an-amazon-rds-snapshot/">snapshot of our PostgreSQL database available as part of their open data program</a> in time for launch.¹</p>
<p>Not a user-friendly download capability², but a download capability nonetheless. And that&rsquo;s the original reason for publishing a usaspending.gov database snapshot.</p>
<p>¹ It&rsquo;s not on AWS anymore, but the announcement page lives on!<br>
² A more traditional data download feature quickly followed the website&rsquo;s launch.</p>

			 <p>After working at a large tech company for nearly six years, I was unprepared for how spoiled I&rsquo;d gotten when working on teams with uniform technology. Teams where everyone is admin on their corporate-issued laptops all running the same OS. Teams where 85% of software engineers use the same IDE.</p>
<p>Within that kind of environment, if you write instructions for setting up and contributing to a Python project, those instructions will almost certainly work on everyone else&rsquo;s machine.</p>
<p>But when no two teammates—let alone potential contributors to our open source software—have the same setup, all bets are off:</p>
<ul>
<li>IT restrictions block the thing</li>
<li>The Makefile doesn&rsquo;t run on Windows</li>
<li>Conda edited .bashrc and stuck its base Python environment at the beginning of $PATH</li>
<li>IDE can&rsquo;t find the virtual environment</li>
<li>Anti-virus blocks the other thing</li>
<li>Docker malarkey</li>

			 <p>Life with <code>uv run</code> is going well. The <a href="https://beckysweger.com/2025/01/06/change-your-life-with-uv.html">aforementioned smart, busy colleagues who mostly program in R</a> have <code>uv</code> installed on their machines and the shared Python scripts are flowing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re now ready for Phase 2 of &ldquo;no more Futzing Around™️ with Python.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day, a colleague wants to update an internally-developed Python package. That person may not write a lot of Python, but they can certainly fix a straightforward bug or typo. So they refer to <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> and find the following instructions for creating a dev environment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repo.</li>
<li>Look at <code>.python-version</code> to find out which version of Python we&rsquo;re using for development.</li>
<li>Install pyenv and use pyenv to install the above version of Python.</li>
<li>Create a virtual environment. It’s tempting to skip this step, but please don’t. You can use python, pyenv-virtualenv, poetry, conda, pdm, hatch, pipenv, rye, or uv to create a virtual environment. <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> recommends whatever tool its author likes.</li>
<li>Activate the virtual environment.</li>
<li>Install the package dev dependencies: <code>pip install -r requirements-dev.txt</code></li>
<li>Install the package as an editable module: <code>pip install -e .</code></li>
<li>Before making your change run the tests to ensure all is well: <code>pytest</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Now that everyone on the team has <code>uv</code> installed, you can simplify <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> to something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repo.</li>
<li>Create a virtual environment: <code>uv venv --seed</code>¹</li>
<li>Install the package dev dependencies: <code>uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt</code></li>
<li>Install the package as an editable module: <code>uv pip install -e .</code></li>
<li>Before making your change run the tests to ensure all is well: <code>uv run pytest</code></li>
</ol>
<p>I like this approach for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It removes barriers to entry for potential collaborators.</li>
<li>Yet it doesn&rsquo;t require existing contributors to change the way they work. People are free to handle their own Python installs, virtual environments, and dependencies as they see fit (as long as they generate annotated requirements.txt files when updating dependencies).²</li>
</ol>
<p>¹ <a href="https://beckysweger.com/2025/01/14/seeding-virtual-environments-with-pip.html"><code>--seed</code> tells <code>uv</code> to include seed packages like <code>pip</code> and <code>setuptools</code> in the virtual environment it creates</a>. It&rsquo;s helpful for people who would rather activate the environment instead of prefixing every command with <code>uv run</code> or <code>uv pip</code>.</p>
<p>² Add <code>uv.lock</code> to <code>.gitignore</code> to remove any confusion on this point.</p>

You can still use your muscle memory <code>source .venv/bin/activate</code> incantation to activate it.</p>
<p>But other muscle memory commands don&rsquo;t work as well, especially those related to <code>pip</code>. By default,  <code>pip</code> isn&rsquo;t installed into uv virtual environments. So you have to do things like <code>uv pip list</code> instead of <code>pip list</code>.</p>
<p>The uv <code>--seed</code> option fixes that by installing <code>pip</code> and other seed packages into the new environment: <code>uv venv --seed</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is there much that the sharer has to do? (I have a requirements.txt file)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope! Assuming that the script and requirements.txt file are in the same directory (and that the person running the script has uv installed):</p>
<p><code>uv run --with-requirements requirements.txt very-useful-script.py</code></p>
<p>You could also <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies">embed the requirements in the script itself</a>. Or install dependencies from <code>pyproject.toml</code> Or use an index other than PyPI. Or load some environment variables before running the script. It&rsquo;s all here: <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run">https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the great things about uv. You can use it to manage an entire Python project, but you don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to: just pick and choose what you need.</p>

			 <p>Skipping GitHub action jobs on forked repos is a surprisingly hard thing to Google. Most advice says to:</p>
<ul>
<li>disable workflows on the forked repo</li>
<li>hard-code a check for the repo&rsquo;s owner name to determine whether or not it&rsquo;s a fork</li>
</ul>
<p>But I work on a <a href="https://github.com/reichlab/variant-nowcast-hub">repository at Day Job™️</a> that has many workflows, some of which are useful to external contributors who fork. Also, why give people manual instructions for something a computer can check?</p>
<p>Secondly, the workflow in question is derived from a template used by other repository owners in our ecosystem. Ideally, there would be a solution that doesn&rsquo;t hard-code an owner name (so we can update the template itself).</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what it looks like in practice—the job below will not run on a fork:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>jobs:
  your-job:
    # Don't run on forked repositories
    if: github.event.repository.fork != true
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
</code></pre>

<p>So I moved everything to micro.blog, which lets you write in markdown while using a hosted service, so you don&rsquo;t have to upgrade hugo and remember how it works and submit a pull request whenever you want to write something.</p>
<p>Also, it is my fervent hope that having a &ldquo;micro&rdquo; blog will silence the nagging voice insisting that each post must be a carefully crafted, highly-edited endeavor.</p>
<p>2025 is the year of blogging&ndash;for real this time!</p>
