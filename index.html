			 <p>Many years ago, I was part of a team that designed a data standard now used throughout the federal government.</p>
<p>We created most of the data standard by passing an Excel spreadsheet around via e-mail. That process worked remarkably well, because the people with the deepest domain knowledge–the people who were absolutely critical to the effort–were comfortable working in spreadsheets.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m making good on the threat to write about the opinions that inform <a href="https://beckysweger.com/2025/02/24/pyprefab-if-you-need-to.html">pyprefab</a>, a command line interface that generates Python package scaffolding.</p>
<p>To be honest, avoiding the doomscroll is part of the motivation for noodling around on this project. But I also really like having pyprefab as a central place to codify my project setup opinions, knowing that every change will be easily incorporated into future work.</p>
<p>One practice I&rsquo;ve come to appreciate is including a <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> document in every project, even if I&rsquo;m the only contributor. Every package created via <a href="https://bsweger.github.io/pyprefab/">pyprefab</a> gets one because I say so.</p>
<h2 id="cyclical-coding">Cyclical coding</h2>
<p>My non-work coding habits are very cyclical. New England winters are good for writing a bunch of Python and learning what&rsquo;s new, summers less so. I&rsquo;m writing this during sugaring season, which means mud season is coming up, along with the spring peepers and baseball. Finally, finally the world will start turning green, and spending free time with the laptop will be less appealing.</p>
<p>Inevitably, the pendulum will swing back, and I&rsquo;ll return to an old project and wonder&hellip;how did that <code>.venv</code> get there? Are we doing the lockfile thing or using pip-compile to generate a requirements.txt? And what is that incantation for previewing the docs? <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> will be there with the answers.</p>

			 <p>The world doesn&rsquo;t need another Python app generator, but I made one anyway. It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyprefab/">pyprefab</a>, and it&rsquo;s a little cli that prompts for a few pieces of information and then creates a Python package that&rsquo;s ready to go (<em>e.g.</em>, script entry point, test suite, Sphinx docs, configured logs).</p>
<p>Beyond having a way to quickly stand up new Python projects just the way I like &lsquo;em, my goals for working on pyprefab are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always worked on internal Python apps and wanted more experience releasing packages to PyPI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using an app instead of, say, writing a <a href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">cookiecutter</a> template makes it easier to test the boilerplate packages being created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wanted something easily shareable at work. We&rsquo;ve already confirmed that uv <a href="https://beckysweger.com/2025/01/23/more-machines-more-python-setup.html">works on everyone&rsquo;s machine</a>, so now people can use <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/">uv tools</a> + pyprefab to spin up a new app without explicitly installing anything else:</p>
<p><code>uvx pyprefab</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>pyprefab is opinionated, so I&rsquo;ll probably write about some of those opinions in the future.</p>

<p>bootstrapping in Python is the root of all evil. By bootstrapping, I mean provisioning Python itself, and configuring a new project so that you can later on install dependencies or build a package. Most problems you have down the road (E.G: packaging problems) actually stem from this</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from <a href="https://www.bitecode.dev/p/a-year-of-uv-pros-cons-and-should">Kevin Samuel, A year of uv: pros, cons, and should you migrate</a></p>
<p>After working as a data engineer at a tech company for nearly six years, on a team composed of software developers who all have the same zippy laptop and the luxury of knowing in advance where their code is going to run, I&rsquo;d almost forgotten about Python&rsquo;s bootstrapping challenges. After starting a new job on a small academic team, I had to remember pretty quickly.</p>
<p>So much of the above article resonates with my recent experience of devising Python setup notes for a team of people with different operating systems who don&rsquo;t have administrative access to their machines.</p>
<p>A delightful, highly-opinionated read about various Python pitfalls, their history, and how <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> can solve nearly all of them.</p>

			 <p>Working in the open has many upsides, one of which is the ability to share stories about a project without revealing anything proprietary.</p>
<p>So this is a story about the software project that culminated in the 2017 relaunch of <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/">usaspending.gov</a>.  Not only was the code open source (<a href="https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency">it still is</a>), but our JIRA tickets were open to all, and we had a website for collaborating with the public and other feds to develop the data standards that power the site.</p>
<p>My time as the 18F technical lead on that project is a career highlight, and it&rsquo;s been on my mind as usaspending.gov and all federal data are getting attention. Feeling an urge to archive, I recently checked to see if the usaspending backend database is still available to the public. <a href="https://onevoicecrm.my.site.com/usaspending/s/database-download">It is</a>!</p>
<p>Having that PostgreSQL archive is important right now, but the original reason for making it available was a creative workaround to a software delivery conundrum.</p>
<p>The law behind an expanded and improved usaspending.gov (the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/994">DATA Act</a>) mandated an implementation no later than May 2017. The team was maybe a sprint away from this deadline when we found a data aggregation bug that caused some incorrect totals on the test website. It was a relatively straightforward problem and absolutely fixable in the remaining time before launch.</p>
<p>However, making that fix would mean no time to implement the last remaining &ldquo;must have&rdquo; feature before going live: a way to download the site&rsquo;s data. Providing the ability to download search results was not only a critical capability⎻it was something promised on the project&rsquo;s road map.</p>
<p>And deviating from that roadmap would have been a sign of failure to the many people who believed that a government-wide, agile, open data software development project could not succeed.</p>
<p>So we faced that classic software delivery quandry: can&rsquo;t move the date, can&rsquo;t change the scope.</p>
<p>We obviously prioritized fixing the data bug. As for providing a data download feature, someone on the team had the idea to contact AWS, who made a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/announcing-usaspending-gov-on-an-amazon-rds-snapshot/">snapshot of our PostgreSQL database available as part of their open data program</a> in time for launch.¹</p>
<p>Not a user-friendly download capability², but a download capability nonetheless. And that&rsquo;s the original reason for publishing a usaspending.gov database snapshot.</p>
<p>¹ It&rsquo;s not on AWS anymore, but the announcement page lives on!<br>
² A more traditional data download feature quickly followed the website&rsquo;s launch.</p>

			 <p>After working at a large tech company for nearly six years, I was unprepared for how spoiled I&rsquo;d gotten when working on teams with uniform technology. Teams where everyone is admin on their corporate-issued laptops all running the same OS. Teams where 85% of software engineers use the same IDE.</p>
<p>Within that kind of environment, if you write instructions for setting up and contributing to a Python project, those instructions will almost certainly work on everyone else&rsquo;s machine.</p>
<p>But when no two teammates—let alone potential contributors to our open source software—have the same setup, all bets are off:</p>
<ul>
<li>IT restrictions block the thing</li>
<li>The Makefile doesn&rsquo;t run on Windows</li>
<li>Conda edited .bashrc and stuck its base Python environment at the beginning of $PATH</li>
<li>IDE can&rsquo;t find the virtual environment</li>
<li>Anti-virus blocks the other thing</li>
<li>Docker malarkey</li>

			 <p>Life with <code>uv run</code> is going well. The <a href="https://beckysweger.com/2025/01/06/change-your-life-with-uv.html">aforementioned smart, busy colleagues who mostly program in R</a> have <code>uv</code> installed on their machines and the shared Python scripts are flowing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re now ready for Phase 2 of &ldquo;no more Futzing Around™️ with Python.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day, a colleague wants to update an internally-developed Python package. That person may not write a lot of Python, but they can certainly fix a straightforward bug or typo. So they refer to <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> and find the following instructions for creating a dev environment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repo.</li>
<li>Look at <code>.python-version</code> to find out which version of Python we&rsquo;re using for development.</li>
<li>Install pyenv and use pyenv to install the above version of Python.</li>
<li>Create a virtual environment. It’s tempting to skip this step, but please don’t. You can use python, pyenv-virtualenv, poetry, conda, pdm, hatch, pipenv, rye, or uv to create a virtual environment. <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> recommends whatever tool its author likes.</li>
<li>Activate the virtual environment.</li>
<li>Install the package dev dependencies: <code>pip install -r requirements-dev.txt</code></li>
<li>Install the package as an editable module: <code>pip install -e .</code></li>
<li>Before making your change run the tests to ensure all is well: <code>pytest</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Now that everyone on the team has <code>uv</code> installed, you can simplify <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> to something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repo.</li>
<li>Create a virtual environment: <code>uv venv --seed</code>¹</li>
<li>Install the package dev dependencies: <code>uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt</code></li>
<li>Install the package as an editable module: <code>uv pip install -e .</code></li>
<li>Before making your change run the tests to ensure all is well: <code>uv run pytest</code></li>
</ol>
<p>I like this approach for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It removes barriers to entry for potential collaborators.</li>
<li>Yet it doesn&rsquo;t require existing contributors to change the way they work. People are free to handle their own Python installs, virtual environments, and dependencies as they see fit (as long as they generate annotated requirements.txt files when updating dependencies).²</li>
</ol>
<p>¹ <a href="https://beckysweger.com/2025/01/14/seeding-virtual-environments-with-pip.html"><code>--seed</code> tells <code>uv</code> to include seed packages like <code>pip</code> and <code>setuptools</code> in the virtual environment it creates</a>. It&rsquo;s helpful for people who would rather activate the environment instead of prefixing every command with <code>uv run</code> or <code>uv pip</code>.</p>
<p>² Add <code>uv.lock</code> to <code>.gitignore</code> to remove any confusion on this point.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s great that a <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv">uv-created Python virtual environment</a> lives where you&rsquo;d expect it to be: in a folder called <code>.venv</code>. You can still use your muscle memory <code>source .venv/bin/activate</code> incantation to activate it.</p>
<p>But other muscle memory commands don&rsquo;t work as well, especially those related to <code>pip</code>. By default,  <code>pip</code> isn&rsquo;t installed into uv virtual environments. So you have to do things like <code>uv pip list</code> instead of <code>pip list</code>.</p>
<p>The uv <code>--seed</code> option fixes that by installing <code>pip</code> and other seed packages into the new environment: <code>uv venv --seed</code>.</p>
<p>I ended up aliasing <code>uv venv</code> to <code>uv venv --seed</code> with the following function in ye old <code>.zshrc</code>:¹</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m gonna write about <code>uv run</code> again, because it&rsquo;s just that handy!</p>
<p>Lou Franco <a href="https://mastodon.social/@loufranco/113783255399204720">asked a very good question</a> about the <a href="https://beckysweger.com/2025/01/06/change-your-life-with-uv.html"><code>uv run</code> post from earlier in the week</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is there much that the sharer has to do? (I have a requirements.txt file)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope! Assuming that the script and requirements.txt file are in the same directory (and that the person running the script has uv installed):</p>
<p><code>uv run --with-requirements requirements.txt very-useful-script.py</code></p>
<p>You could also <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies">embed the requirements in the script itself</a>. Or install dependencies from <code>pyproject.toml</code> Or use an index other than PyPI. Or load some environment variables before running the script. It&rsquo;s all here: <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run">https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the great things about uv. You can use it to manage an entire Python project, but you don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to: just pick and choose what you need.</p>
<p>P.S. Lou <a href="https://loufranco.com/">has a blog</a> and is <a href="https://loufranco.com/tech-debt-book">writing a book about tech debt</a>. You should read them!</p>

			 <p>Imagine that your colleagues—very smart, busy people who mostly program in R—need a dataset that&rsquo;s difficult to create. And they want the ability to recreate the dataset as often as necessary. The freedom to tweak the code and experiment with the inputs.</p>
<h2 id="without-uv">Without uv</h2>
<p>Good news! You have a script that does exactly what they need. It&rsquo;s written in Python instead of R, but anyone can run it by following these simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Python. Python is already on your laptop, but don&rsquo;t use that one. Install a different Python. Actually, just install pyenv and then use pyenv to install Python.</li>
<li>Create a virtual environment. It&rsquo;s tempting to skip this step, but please don&rsquo;t. You can use python, pyenv-virtualenv, poetry, conda, pdm, hatch, pipenv, rye, or uv to create a virtual environment. I will make a recommendation. Next month I will make a different recommendation.</li>
<li>Activate your virtual environment.</li>
<li>The script uses polars, biopython, and zstandard, so use pip to install those dependencies. Don&rsquo;t install polars 1.17.0, everything will break.</li>
<li>Run the script: <code>python very-useful-script.py</code></li>

			 <p>Skipping GitHub action jobs on forked repos is a surprisingly hard thing to Google. Most advice says to:</p>
<ul>
<li>disable workflows on the forked repo</li>
<li>hard-code a check for the repo&rsquo;s owner name to determine whether or not it&rsquo;s a fork</li>
</ul>
<p>But I work on a <a href="https://github.com/reichlab/variant-nowcast-hub">repository at Day Job™️</a> that has many workflows, some of which are useful to external contributors who fork. Also, why give people manual instructions for something a computer can check?</p>
<p>Secondly, the workflow in question is derived from a template used by other repository owners in our ecosystem. Ideally, there would be a solution that doesn&rsquo;t hard-code an owner name (so we can update the template itself).</p>
<p>After following <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/github-actions/dump-context">this advice from Simon Willison</a> about dumping the GitHub actions context, I stumbled upon <code>github.event.repository.fork</code> 🎉</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what it looks like in practice—the job below will not run on a fork:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>jobs:
  your-job:
    # Don't run on forked repositories
    if: github.event.repository.fork != true
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

<p>So I moved everything to micro.blog, which lets you write in markdown while using a hosted service, so you don&rsquo;t have to upgrade hugo and remember how it works and submit a pull request whenever you want to write something.</p>
<p>Also, it is my fervent hope that having a &ldquo;micro&rdquo; blog will silence the nagging voice insisting that each post must be a carefully crafted, highly-edited endeavor.</p>
<p>2025 is the year of blogging&ndash;for real this time!</p>
